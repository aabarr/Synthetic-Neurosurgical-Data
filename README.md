# Synthetic Neurosurgical Data

This repository is related to the study: Zero-Shot Generation of Synthetic Neurosurgical Data with Large Language Models (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.09566). Provided are the synthetic datasets generated with GPT-4o and CTGAN. These datasets are generated based on the following real-world neurosurgical data: https://zenodo.org/records/5879095

# Datasets

The collection includes 13 datasets, including the following:

- Ten datasets (n = 139) generated with GPT-4o labeled: LLM_gen#_139.xlsx
- One dataset (n = 1390) generated with GPT-4o labeled: LLM_1390.xlsx
- One dataset (n = 139) generated with CTGAN labeled: CTGAN_139.xlsx
- One dataset (n = 1390) generated with CTGAN labeled: CTGAN_1390.xlsx
